# Learn-Go

Welcome to this repository, the purpose behind this repo is to show how I'm learning Go and how this can also help you to learn this language, here I'll be leaving pieces of my code in Go and putting sources that you can learn Go from.

This is mainly my journey on Learning it and I hope I can improve all of this overtime.
